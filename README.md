# Catch-The-Kenny-Game
This is a game that you try to catch the Kenny. The Kenny moves fast and when you catch him, you gain one point and you have 10 seconds to catch him. Your highest score is saved to score board and when you open the game, it is shown to you. Also, your score during playing the game is also demonstrated at the top of the screen. I used UserDefaults to save the data because we have just a single piece of data in this game, so there was no problem to use UseDefaults as a data source of the game. I also used if statements, arrays, timer, and alert method. In that regard, when the time's up, you see a pop up which appears to ask you a question concerning whether you want to play or not. You can select "OK" or "Replay" answers.
